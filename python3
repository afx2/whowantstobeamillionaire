    print (f'''    Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? is a quiz competition 
    where contestants have to correctly answer a series of multiple-choice questions
    in order to advance to the next level / question.
    There are 4 questions in total and each question has no time limit. 
    Contestants also get three Lifelines to assist them if they get stuck on a particular question.

    Lifelines are:
    50:50 = will drop 2 wrong answers, giving the contestant a 50% chance of answering correctly
    Change Question =  replaces the current question with another one
    Summon the Genie =  the summoned Genie will disclose the correct answer of the current question

    Contestants can use a single lifeline only once during the game.

    If the contestant gives a wrong answer, the contestant loses and the game stops.
    If the contestant answers correctly to all four questions he wins 1 million Python Dollar,
    becoming the new Python Millionaire.

    Let's go on with the first question...
    Good Luck!''')
